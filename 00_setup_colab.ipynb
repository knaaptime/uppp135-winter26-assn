    "The `geosnap` provides access to a [wide variety](https://open.quiltdata.com/b/spatial-ucr) of geospatial datasets focused on demographic, economic, institutional, environmental and land-use characteristics for use in applied research or pedagogical examples. In the general case or for one-off uses, all datasets can be streamed directly over the web. For repeated use (and quicker access), the datasets can also be stored in a local drive. When the data are stored on disk, and the user does not define a specific location, the [`platformdirs`](https://platformdirs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package is used to determine a reasonable storage location. Alternatively, a user can define a specific directory where datasets can be placed. In the latter scenario, it's important for the user to specify this directory *each time* they instantiate a `geosnap.DataStore` instance, otherwise geosnap will search for the default location and, finding no data, it will revert to streaming.\n",
